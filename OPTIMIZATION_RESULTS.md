🏆 THE WINNERS (3-WAY TIE!)
THREE configurations tied at $2.33 profit:

✅ RSI 40, Sell 70, Stop 3%, Target 10% (ORIGINAL)
✅ RSI 40, Sell 70, Stop 2%, Target 10%
✅ RSI 40, Sell 70, Stop 3%, Target 15%

All with 100% win rate and 4 trades! 🎯

💡 HUGE DISCOVERIES:
1. RSI 40 is THE SWEET SPOT! ⭐
RSI 35: $1.95 (only 3 trades - too conservative)
RSI 40: $2.33 (4 trades - PERFECT)
RSI 45: $2.17 (4 trades but worse entries)
```
**Winner: RSI 40!** Not too hot, not too cold! 🎯

### **2. Sell at 70 is Better Than 65**
```
Sell at 65: $2.14 (exits too early)
Sell at 70: $2.33 (lets winners run)
```
**Winner: RSI 70!** Let your profits run! 💰

### **3. Stop Loss Doesn't Matter (Here)**
```
3% stop: $2.33
2% stop: $2.33 (same!)
```
**Why?** None of the trades hit stop loss! All won via RSI signal or profit target! 🎉

### **4. Profit Target Doesn't Matter (Here)**
```
10% target: $2.33
15% target: $2.33 (same!)
Why? None of the trades hit profit target! All exited via RSI overbought signal! 📈

🎓 What This Teaches You:
The Strategy:

Enters when RSI < 40 (moderate oversold)
Exits when RSI > 70 (overbought)
Stop loss and profit targets never triggered!
Strategy is purely RSI-driven

Translation:

RSI signals are working well
Trades exit before hitting stops or targets
Keep it simple: RSI 40/70 is optimal


🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
Optimal Settings for EUR/USD (based on your tests):
yamlstrategy:
  rsi_oversold: 40
  rsi_overbought: 70

risk:
  stop_loss: 0.03      # Doesn't trigger, but good safety
  profit_target: 0.10  # Doesn't trigger, but good safety
Keep it simple! The original RSI 40/70 is best! ✅
